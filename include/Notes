The panelOrder array for each display type translates the physical panel order to the addresses 
to light each panel on the first module in the display.

Addresses in the Cronixie panelOrder array are for 0 to 9 on the first (leftmost) display 
{ 5, 0, 6, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 4 }
- e.g. panel 0 is address 5, panel 1 is address 0, .... panel 8 is address 9, panel 9 is address 4.  
Hardware looks after lighting the second LED (and the third LED on the L displays) for each panel.   
Add multiples of 10 for other Cronixies - e.g. 0 on second Cronixie is address 15, 0 on third Cronixie is 25, etc.
The array contains the LED addresses. The physical order of the Cronixie panels is 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
           
Addresses in the EleksTube panelOrder array are for 0 to 9 on the first (leftmost) display 
{ 5, 0, 6, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 4 }
- e.g. panel 0 is address 5, panel 1 is address 0, .... panel 8 is address 9, panel 9 is address 4.
The second LED for each pair that lights a panel is 10 addresses higher than the first.     
Add multiples of 20 for other EleksTubes - e.g. 0 on second EleksTube is address 25, 0 on third EleksTutbe is 45, etc.
The array contains the LED addresses. The physical order of the EleksTube panels is 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Addresses in the Lixie panelOrder array are for 0 to 9 on the first (rightmost) display
{ 3, 4, 2, 0, 8, 6, 5, 7, 9, 1 } 
- e.g. panel 0 is address 3, panel 1 is address 4, .... panel 8 is address 9, panel 9 is address 1. 
The second LED for each pair that lights a panel is 10 addresses higher than the first.     
Add multiples of 20 for other Lixies - e.g. 0 on second Lixie is address 23, 0 on third Lixie is 43, etc.
The array contains the LED addresses. The physical order of the Lixie panels is 
6, 5, 7, 4, 8, 3, 9, 2, 0, 1.
